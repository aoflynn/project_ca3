#Lost  & Found
####CASE 3 Year Project

Our third year project was a geolocation lost and found iOS application. We received a First Class Honours in this project with an overall mark of 71%. This project was worth 15 credits out of our 60 credit year.

Users are able to post on the application that they have either lost or found an item. This is called a listing. A listing is made up of information like a title, lost or found status, a category, a description, the location of where the item was lost or found, and an image of the item.

One of the key features of the application is the ability to drop a pin on a map where the item was lost or found. Once a user places a listing, if they search the map, they will be able to see their listing as a pin annotation on the map, along with all of the other listings. Users can search the map or use the category search to find listings.

The application acts as a medium of contact between people who wish to find an item they have
lost or for people who wish to return an item that they have found. The listing page supplies an
email address and an optional number for other users to inquire about that listing. 


##### Tech

We used a number of different technologies during this project:

* [Parse](https://www.parse.com) - Backend as a Service
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - The IDE in which the app was built. XCode provides the tools required to run and build iOS applications. 
* [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) - The programming language in which the application was developed in. 
* [iOS 8 SDK](https://developer.apple.com/ios/download/) - We used the newest software development kit to create the application.
